      <h1>My Story</h1>
    <p>I grew up in a <b>very musical</b> family. My father played saxophone with a <em>"band of buddies"</em> from his college days, and he is now the local high school band teacher. My mother is the singer in the family, and she is a regular lead performer in musicals with out community theater. Needless to say, my three siblings and I all took music lessons. But even though I was the one who never could settle on a favorite instrument, I'm the <i>only one</i> who went into the music business!</p>
    <p>Early on, music became my thing. I could name any song on the radio and tell you not only who was singing it, but who wrote it and when. At my senior prom, I was at the turntable <b>more</b> than I was on the dance floor.</p>
    <p>During college, I supplemented my income by DJ-ing fraternity- and sorority-sponsored parties and other campus events. Eventually, I landed a job with a radio station. That was cool, but I missed being part of all the action and fun that people awere having at a party <b>rocking with music</b>. Let's face it, being a DJ is the closest thing to being a <u><i>rock star</i></u> without having to <em>play</em> an instrument!</p>
    <p>So, I started <i><b>DJ Turntable</b></i>, and I haven't stopped spinning since. I <em>love </em>what I do and so will you- <b>Dylan Jackson</b></p>
